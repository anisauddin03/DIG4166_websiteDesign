In my first year at Birmingham City Unviersity, I took part in a module called Website Design & Development where I used a software called Figma to design my website and used html & css to create a website based on a topic I was given.

In this repository, I have uploaded the files that contains the html and css to develop the website. This website is not fully functional, however is able to link to other pages and provides allows user to fill in their details.
Moreover, it is responsive to a mobile design and follows the guidelines of accessability which is crucial for users who require assistance and allows thorough navigation across websites. I also added validating docuements that have read through the scripts and pointed errors or warnings using the W3C validator:

This website consists of following a walkthrough of building a website from a YouTube user called GreatStack (but many changes made and error corrections:

The images are all from Google, mainly from the University website:

Thank you for reading! I hope this helps others to understand main blocks of developing a website.
